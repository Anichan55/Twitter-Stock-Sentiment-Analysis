# Twitter-Stock-Sentiment-Analysis

This project aims to analyze the tweets related to a particular company and predict its future stock trend with sentiment analysis. This script predicts the overall sentiment of the stock over the last 2 days and can be helpful for investors in making a judgement on whether it is a safe stock to invest in or not. This script uses pre trained NLP model Flair for sentiment analysis and machine learning principles to discover the possible effect of "public sentiment" on "market trends".
